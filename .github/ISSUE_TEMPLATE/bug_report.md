# Checklist
  - [ ] I have checked that my issue [doesn't exist yet](https://github.com/CombineSlayer24/Black-Mesa-Character-Expansion-SNPC/issues).
  - [ ] I am able to reproduce this issue with provided description below.
  - [ ] I have checked without any addons loaded except for VJ Base and VJ BMCE
  - [ ] I am running the original addon without any modifications made to the addon.

# Versions
 * VJ Base version *(Workshop Release / GitHub Release)*: 
 * Garry's Mod version: 

NOTE 1: *Github version of VJ Base is the more up-to-date version, as it's constantly getting updated, rather than the workshop version that has the complete stable version.*

NOTE 2: **Cracked versions of GMod will not be supported. Garry's Mod is cheap, and having a cracked version of Garry's Mod doesn't have the updated Lua function stuff, making addons in Cracked GMod broken.**
